= Blue Bot (c) Maria Williams 2016 - is an extensible chat bot written in Java =
=    Its goal is to be modular enough that one can define their own connectors =
=    yet defined well enough so as to not create ambiguity during development. =
=                                                                              =
=    Blue is also scriptable. This means that any language which you can       =
=    compile to JVM bytecode can be used to write plugins for Blue provided    =
=    that they implement the plugin interface. On top of being extendable via  =
=    compiled plugins Blue also offers a Lua interface so that plugins can be  =
=    written in Lua as well. This makes scripting Blue much more accessible.   =
=------------------------------------------------------------------------------=
= Note:                                                                        =
=     While Blue was designed and built for Wikia chats it can also be used    =
=     for other chat platforms provided that you write your own connector that =
=     implements the connector interface. If you do this you gain the added    =
=     bonus of all of Blue's plugins being able to work via your chat as well. =
